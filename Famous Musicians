I created a table with some famous Classic Rock bands and their lead singers.

CREATE TABLE singer (id integer, name text, band text); 

INSERT INTO singer VALUES
(1, 'Steven Tyler', 'Aerosmith'),
(2, 'Jon Bon Jovi', 'Bon Jovi'),
(3, 'Eric Clapton', 'Cream'),
(4, 'Phil Colins', 'Genesis'),
(5, 'Alice Cooper', 'Alice Cooper'); 

I went ahead and figured out where the lead singers were born.
CREATE TABLE location (id integer, city text); 

INSERT INTO location VALUES 
(1, 'New York City'),
(2,'Perth Amboy'),
(3, 'Ripley'),
(4, 'London'),
(5, 'Detroit'); 

I created a table to fill in some of the bands most famous songs.
CREATE TABLE song (id integer, name text);

INSERT INTO song VALUES
(1, 'Love in the Elevator'),
(2, 'Livin on a Prayer'),
(3, 'Layla'),
(4, 'In the Air Tonight'),
(5, 'Schools Out'); 

I went ahead and joined the two tables where the singers name is and where they were bron.
SELECT singer.name, location.city FROM singer
JOIN location
ON singer.id = location.id; 

I also joined the lead singer name to the name of their most famous songs. 
SELECT singer.name, song.name FROM singer
JOIN song
ON singer.id = song.id
